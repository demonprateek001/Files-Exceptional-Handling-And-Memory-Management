Errors in Python can be broadly classified into two categories: Syntax Errors and Exceptions. Syntax errors occur when the parser detects an incorrect statement, while exceptions are raised when an error occurs during the execution of syntactically correct code."

This is crucial for performing cleanup operations, such as closing files or releasing resources, that must happen whether an error is thrown or not. The finally block will always execute when the try block exits, ensuring that necessary actions are taken even in the event of an unexpected exception."

        "\n",
        "  - Multithreading is important in certain applications because it allows a program to perform multiple tasks at the same time, making it more efficient, responsive, and better at handling concurrent operations â€” especially when dealing with I/O-bound tasks like network requests, file operations, or user interaction.\n",
        "\n",
        "âœ… Key Reasons Why Multithreading Is Important:\n",
        "1. Improves Application Responsiveness\n",
        "In GUI or web applications, multithreading prevents the interface from freezing during long operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: You can download a file in the background while the user continues using the app.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Better Utilization of Waiting Time (I/O-bound tasks)\n",
        "Threads are ideal for I/O-bound tasks (e.g., reading files, making API calls), where the program spends time waiting.\n",
        "\n",
        "While one thread waits, others can keep working.\n",
        "\n",
        "âœ… Good for: Web scrapers, chat servers, file readers, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Concurrent Operations\n",
        "Multithreading enables tasks like logging, animation, or background updates to run concurrently.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: A music app can play music while downloading lyrics in another thread.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Efficient Use of System Resources\n",
        "For tasks that donâ€™t need heavy CPU processing, threads help make better use of system I/O channels and RAM without overloading the processor.\n",
        "\n",
